# Project Portfolio

## Technologies Used

I used Bootstrap and Jquery to create a basic web portfolio.

## Process/Approach

I wanted to put together a website that let me practice my HTML and CSS styling basics, and then I organized the site using flexbox. Afterward, I tried putting in basic css animations to small items on my page like buttons, links, and headings. 

## Unsolved Problems

I couldn't figure out how to get an element to fade in when a user scrolled over to that section.

## Biggest Wins/Challenges

My biggest challenge and win was getting the carousel to be somewhat functional. At first, I couldn't figure out why the carousel was just displaying the images all at once instead of scrolling through each individually. Then I realized I had to add bootstrap to my head in HTML, but then by doing that my styling got thrown off. So I had to go and adjust everything by section.
